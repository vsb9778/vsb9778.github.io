            Hello, my name is Varun Bharthavarapu! I was born in the Bronx, but has lived on Staten Island for my whole life and I went 
            to New Dorp High School as a honors student. During my time there, I have joined and stayed in many clubs like the Robotics, Math, 
            and Computer Exploration Clubs for a long time. I enjoy playing video games, playing tennis, and hanging out with my friends as 
            part of my free time.
